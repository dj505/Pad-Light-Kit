# Images go here!
To work properly, images must be formatted a specific way.

# Instructions
1. Use your favourite pixel art animation editor thing to put together an animation. I like Piskel, since it makes this process easy. Make sure your canvas is 5x5 pixels!
2. Once your animation is ready, export it as a PNG image. **Make sure it's saved with 1 column, with as many rows as you have frames.**
3. Open up your image in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), or your preferred image editing software. Re-export the image as a bitmap with 24 bit colour depth and no special encoding stuff (make sure run length encoding is off, and opt out of saving any extra information if possible)
4. Drop your new bitmap spritesheet in the "Image" folder, with the filename `image.bmp`

Your animation should now display :) Example bitmaps will be provided once this project has been properly tested.

(Thanks to stuartm2 for bmp_reader.py! I hope it's okay for me to use this, there was no license attached to the original project. If not, please let me know!)
