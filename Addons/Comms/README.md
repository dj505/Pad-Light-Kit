# Comms
This addon is made for **panel PCB rev. 2 and earlier**. This may not be necessary for future revisions of the panel PCB.  
This addon is also a **work in progress** and is not ready for use.

The "Comms" addon is meant to allow each panel to communicate robustly using RS485 through SP3485 chips to synchronize lighting patterns and other settings.
